# Wallace Class Overview

The Wallace Class Patrol ship came out of the on going developments of the Defiant Class starship and a realisation that after the Dominion War Starfleet was very low on ships to carry out patrol duties across the various boarders of Federation Space. The Wallace Class ship is designed to operate in close proximity to a Federation Starbase or Fleet as it requires monthly resupplies for its 18 crew members, the ships hull is filled to the brim with weapon systems and the ships warp core leaving little space for the crew beyond the bunk spaces.

For the ships officers their office space doubles as their quarters the Wallace Class is simply too small for any other configuration.
